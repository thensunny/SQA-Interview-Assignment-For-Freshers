## Details Discussion on the Assignment Issue report
 This Testing Issue Report serves as a critical document for capturing and tracking issues discovered during the manual testing of the 
 application. Understanding this report is essential for freshers in QA to ensure they can effectively identify, document, and 
 communicate issues. <br>

**Key Components of the Testing Issue Report** <br>
**Test ID:** <br>
Each issue is assigned a unique identifier (ID) for easy tracking and reference. This helps in quickly locating specific issues within the report. <br>
**Test Title:** <br>
A brief description of the issue. This should clearly convey what the problem is, allowing team members to grasp the context without needing to dive into details immediately. <br>
**Description:** <br>
A detailed explanation of the issue, outlining: <br>
-What happened. <br>
-How it was discovered.<br>
-What steps were taken to reproduce the issue. <br>
-Any additional context that may be relevant for understanding the problem. <br>
**Severity/Priority:** <br>
This indicates the impact of the issue on the application. <br>
Severity: How severe the issue is (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor). <br>
Priority: How quickly it needs to be addressed (e.g., High, Medium, Low). This distinction helps the development team prioritize fixes based on user impact and urgency. <br>
**Steps to Reproduce:** <br>
A clear, numbered list of steps that someone else can follow to reproduce the issue. This is crucial for developers or other testers to validate the issue. <br>
**Expected Result:** <br>
This section specifies what the expected behavior of the application should be when following the steps outlined. It provides a benchmark for determining whether the issue is valid. <br>
**Actual Result:** <br>
A description of what actually happened when the steps to reproduce were followed. This is crucial for identifying discrepancies between expected and actual behavior. <br>
**Attachments/Screenshots:** <br>
If applicable, any screenshots or additional documentation that illustrate the issue should be included. Visual aids can often clarify complex problems and provide context. <br>
**Status:** <br>
This indicates whether the issue is Open, In Progress, Resolved, or Closed. Keeping track of the status helps in managing the workflow and ensuring accountability. <br>
**Assigned To:** <br>
This section identifies who is responsible for addressing the issue. Knowing who is assigned can help in following up and ensuring timely resolution. <br>
**Comments/Notes:** <br>
A space for additional information, updates, or communication regarding the issue. This could include feedback from developers, discussions about potential solutions, or notes on testing after the fix has been implemented.<br>
Importance of the Testing Issue Report. <br>
**Communication Tool:** <br> This report serves as a bridge between testers and developers, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding issues that need addressing.
**Documentation:** <br> It provides a historical record of the testing process, which is invaluable for future reference and learning.
**Quality Assurance:** <br> By systematically documenting issues, the report helps ensure that all identified bugs are addressed before the application goes live, enhancing the overall quality of the product.


 ## Conclusion
 This QA Testing Assignment not only enhances manual testing skills but also provides valuable insights into the overall quality assurance process. By systematically validating the homepage's functionality, it ensures a high-quality user experience for the end users.
For freshers, understanding how to create and manage a Testing Issue Report is a foundational skill in QA.
